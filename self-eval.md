# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
I had a great time implementing all the things that I've learned, and googling answers to my questions! It was a great problem solving activity.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
I could do better with taking breaks, but I get so zoned in on the task that I lose track of time.
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
I would really like to remember how to write a class without having to reference examples
